## Background
FedRAMP Community Working Groups (CWGs) are public, informal and collaborative groups that facilitate industry-led knowledge sharing on commercial and government best practices for information security. Every FedRAMP CWG has the following primary objectives:
- Ensure FedRAMP has direct insight into community activities, goals, achievements, best practices, etc. in specific areas to inform creation of standards and policies prior to their formal development.
- Ensure that FedRAMP stakeholders have equal public access to information from FedRAMP and an open forum and semi-structured opportunities to work towards shared goals in different and innovative ways.
