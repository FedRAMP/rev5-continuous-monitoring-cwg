## Background
FedRAMP Community Working Groups (CWGs) are public, informal and collaborative groups that facilitate industry-led knowledge sharing on commercial and government best practices for information security. Every FedRAMP CWG has the following primary objectives:
- Ensure FedRAMP has direct insight into community activities, goals, achievements, best practices, etc. in specific areas to inform creation of standards and policies prior to their formal development.
- Ensure that FedRAMP stakeholders have equal public access to information from FedRAMP and an open forum and semi-structured opportunities to work towards shared goals in different and innovative ways.

## Rev5 Continuous Monitoring Working Group
The Rev 5 Continuous Monitoring Reporting Working Group will be an informal, collaborative group; involve voluntary participation of all members; provide transparent information about sessions; and its scope excludes the development of FedRAMP standards and policies. The Rev 5 Continuous Monitoring Reporting Working Group is focused on the development of continuous monitoring reports, and how these reports for CSPs with FedRAMP Rev. 5 authorizations will be developed to meet agency needs.

## Participation
FedRAMP CWGs are open to the public and all members of the community may participate or follow along. 

The Rev5 Continuous Monitoring Working Group is especially relevant for members of the following communities:
- Cloud Service Providers who are currently FedRAMP Authorized under Rev 4/5 (or those still undergoing reviews)
- Agency Security Teams who are currently FedRAMP Authorized under Rev 4/5 (or those still undergoing reviews)  
- Third-Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs)
- FedRAMP Advisors/Consultants 

## Key Community Working Groups Activities
FedRAMP advocates may drive discussion on specific topics of interest to FedRAMP but participants are strongly encouraged to self-organize around activities related to the CWG.
  - **Transition of all Oversight Activities to Agencies**
  - **Identify and Share Best Practices in Continuous Monitoring**
  - **Keep Legacy Authorized Parties abreast of Authorization Changes**
    
## Interaction with FedRAMP
The Rev5 Continuous Monitoring Working Group will be managed by the following member of the FedRAMP PMO:
- Paul Agosta, [@paulagosta](https://www.github.com/paulagosta)

Community working group managers are PMO participants responsible for administrative tasks and connective tissue. They will:
  - Provide general working group facilitation, ensuring folks stay on track with the agenda, and that everyone is able to participate appropriately.
  - Schedule meetings and post a public calendar, ensure agendas are developed, the meeting platform works appropriately, and notes are captured and posted.
  - Occasionally pose questions to the group in a way that is clearly designed to spark general discussion around a topic to see individual opinions and responses.
  - Select community moderators from public applications in alignment with the group charter.

In addition, the following member of the FedRAMP PMO will support this community as FedRAMP advocate, sharing additional information and addressing feedback as appropriate:
- Ryan Hodges, [@ryan-hodges-gsa](https://www.github.com/ryan-hodges-gsa)

FedRAMP Advocates are PMO folks engaging with the CWGs and advocating for FedRAMP in them, with a focus on technical content. They will:
  - Answer questions related to how FedRAMP’s standards and policies can best be informed by the activities performed in the working group.
  - Clarify FedRAMP’s goals and objectives related to the development of standards and policies.
  - Share public prototypes, examples, sample code, etc. developed by FedRAMP to be placed in the public domain.
  - Contribute to the development of additional public prototypes, examples, sample code, etc. developed by participants of the working group where that work is public and contributions will remain in the public domain.

All communication related to this community must take place in public; private messages and emails related to this community will be ignored by the Community Manager and FedRAMP advocates. Industry professionals should be aware there are limitations on how the federal government and its representatives can engage in CWGs. FedRAMP will not use working groups to seek consensus advice, review, or approval.
